# Horrorgame-HDRP
This is not the first game I have developed, but this game is still in development. This means that there is no full version yet and therefore bugs can occur. Right now, my main priority for the game is to make sure that players can set their preferences correctly. I also put a lot of emphasis on the UI and therefore usability. For more information, I have also linked a "Trello Page" to share my project plans.
